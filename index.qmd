## Welcome {.unnumbered}

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of **student success rates** across schools in Tunisia. The dataset contains information about all educational levels, including:

- Number of students enrolled per school and level
- Number of students who successfully passed
- Success rates calculated and compared across regions

## Project Overview

::: {.callout-note}
## About the Data
The dataset `liste_reussite_eleves.xls` contains **7,787 records** from **1,453 schools** covering **24 governorates** in Tunisia.
:::

### Key Features

This analysis includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Adding success rate percentages and mapping governorates
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding the distribution of success rates
3. **Visualizations**: Interactive charts and maps showing regional differences
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying patterns and significant differences

## Quick Statistics

```{r}
#| label: quick-stats
#| echo: false

# Load the data
.libPaths(Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER"))
source("R/load_data.R")

# Calculate summary statistics
total_students <- sum(school_data$nb_students, na.rm = TRUE)
total_passed <- sum(school_data$nb_passed, na.rm = TRUE)
overall_rate <- round((total_passed / total_students) * 100, 2)
n_schools <- n_distinct(school_data$school_code)
n_governorates <- n_distinct(school_data$governorate)
```

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Students | `r format(total_students, big.mark = ",")` |
| Total Passed | `r format(total_passed, big.mark = ",")` |
| Overall Success Rate | `r overall_rate`% |
| Number of Schools | `r n_schools` |
| Number of Governorates | `r n_governorates` |
